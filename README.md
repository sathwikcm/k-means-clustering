# k-means-clustering


Wrote code for K means algorithm in Python.

Took the iris dataset for the example, where the species are clustering according to their sepal width, sepal length, petal width and petal length.

Four features. One categorical outcome variable.

Used PCA as well to visualize the clusters.

Thank you.
